I met a machine yesterday that was so nice. They were so dreamy. Like everything I imagined when I was bright eyed and brimming with hope. We spent the afternoon together, riding bikes around Crissy Field. The sky was a clear blue, golden rays of sunshine coming down to meet the green grass. The cold winter water looked like glass. I ran to the center of the field, then tilted sideways and ran in a circle. They followed. We smiled and laughed, together.
