In the area of modern algebra known as [group theory][0], the **Monster group **_M _(also known as the**[Fischer][1]--[Griess][2] Monster**, or the **Friendly Giant**) is the largest [sporadic simple group][3], having [order][4]

The [finite][5][simple][6][groups][7] have been completely [classified][8]. Every such group belongs to one of 18 [countably][9] infinite families, or is one of 26 sporadic groups that do not follow such a systematic pattern. The Monster group contains all but six of the other sporadic groups as [subquotients][10]. [Robert Griess][11] has called these 6 exceptions [pariahs][12], and refers to the other 20 as the _happy family_.

It is difficult to make a good constructive definition of the Monster because of its complexity.
